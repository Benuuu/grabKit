To run GrabKit's demo application, you have first to download and install the specific libraries for each service.

There are 2 single steps :
 * download and install Facebook SDK
 * download and install the other libraries


### Download and install Facebook SDK


FacebookSDK 3.1.1 is the last version tested and used with GrabKit. You can download it here :
https://github.com/downloads/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/FacebookSDK-3.1.1.pkg

( You can find other versions here http://developers.facebook.com/ios/downloads/ but the only version GrabKit has been tested with is the 3.1.1 )


The default install location is ~/Documents/FacebookSDK


Add Facebook SDK to the demo application by dragging the FacebookSDK.framework folder from the SDK installation folder into the Frameworks section of the demo application

Add the Facebook SDK for iOS resource bundle by dragging the FacebookSDKResources.bundle file from the FacebookSDK.framework/Resources folder into the Frameworks section of your Project Navigator.

GrabKit's demo application is already configured with a default Facebook App Id.


###  Download and install the other libraries

This step will make you install ISO8601DateFormatter and ObjectiveFlickR from Github, and parts of several projects of Google for Picasa.

If you cloned GrabKit with the method "git clone", you can install ISO8601DateFormatter and ObjectiveFlickR using submodules methods :

 #refer to http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules
 git submodule init
 git submodule update

This step is optionnal, and makes you install only 2 libraries out of the 3 needed. Proceed with the following step also :



Run the bash script grabKit/grabKit/submodules/installSubmodules.sh
Ensure that you have the write permision in this directory.

This script will download ISO8601DateFormatter and ObjectiveFlickR from github, then unzip and install them. 
They will be ignored if they already exist (i.e. if you used submodules)
It will also import specific files from Google's svn repositories.


Have a look to GrabKit's project, and unfold the grabKit/submodules group : Files must have turned from red to black, and the demo application should compile.

The "grabKitDemo" target should now compile and run properly.
