GrabKit v1.2 changelog :

* All Grabbers can now grab the data of the Cover of an album, and build a GRKPhoto from it. 
  Use the Two methods added to the GRKServiceGrabberProtocol, and implemented in every grabber :
	* [GRKServiceGrabber fillCoverPhotoOfAlbum:andCompleteBlock:andErrorBlock:];
	* [GRKServiceGrabber fillCoverPhotoOfAlbums:andCompleteBlock:andErrorBlock:];					                 
* GRKAlbum : Adding the property GRKPhoto * coverPhoto
* Facebook grabber : added grabbing of the "tagged photos" of the user.
* Facebook grabber : now uses batched queries
* Facebbok grabber : optimization when retrieving data of a photo (loading only the needed data)
* GrabKit now includes the official release of Facebook iOS SDK 3.0 (not the beta version anymore)
* FlickR grabber : uses queued queries to retrieve covers of albums (FlickR API doens't offer batch methods)
* GrabKit now includes the last version of ObjectiveFlickR project (fixing issue #5)
* Picasa grabber : uses queued queries to retrieve covers of albums (Picasa API offers batch methods but they are totally unusable)
* Removed each specific kind of blocks to handle queries results (GRKFacebookQueryHandlingBlock, GRKFlickrQueryHandlingBlock, ...). These blocks are replaced by GRKQueryResultBlock.
* GRKAlbum : the method "getDateForProperty:" is now "dateForProperty:"
* GRKPhoto : the method "getDateForProperty:" is now "dateForProperty:"
* adding KVO on property "count" of GRKAlbum (useful to notify changes of this value, as services may return a wrong value)
